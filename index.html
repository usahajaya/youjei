      <p>
        YOUJEI is a brand born from a family story. Established around 2024,
        YOUJEI was created by the children of a small business owner whose
        family business, UJ (Usaha Jaya), has been operating since 2002 as a
        vegetable trading business in Lembang, Bandung, West Java. The name
        YOUJEI comes from the English pronunciation of the letters U and J,
        which still refers to UJ. The name was chosen because “UJ” had already
        been used by another brand. Between 2023 and 2026, UJ faced difficult
        times. A decline in vegetable supply, the loss of partnerships with
        farmers, and changing economic conditions led to operational and
        financial challenges. Some farmers sold their land, while others started
        their own businesses. These challenges greatly affected the business,
        especially with operational assets that still required maintenance and
        taxes despite reduced activity. YOUJEI was not created to replace UJ,
        but to continue the values, responsibility, and spirit that had been
        built before. While UJ focuses on agriculture and vegetables, YOUJEI
        focuses on apparel. Both exist side by side. We strive to run this brand
        with honesty and care. Every product is made with intention, using
        materials and printing methods that match their description, because
        trust matters to us.
